Here you find everything you need to know, how you can use our own logger.  
As this is a part of the API, you can also use this logger in your own plugin.

## Why we have our own Logger
The first and main advantage is, it is __simpler to use__ if you want to log something.
Especially for contributors, that don't know how we like to log things.
This also helps to log things in a consistent way.

__ingame logging__

__log history__

__debug logging__
