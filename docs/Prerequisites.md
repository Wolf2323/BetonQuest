# Welcome!
Welcome to BetonQuest! Thank you for trying it out. This plugin can do some really 
cool stuff and therefore requires some learning.

##Installation
In order to use <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/betonquest.2117/" target="_blank">BetonQuest</a> you (obviously)
 need to add the `BetonQuest.jar` that you downloaded from Spigot to your plugins folder.
You also need <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/citizens.13811/" target="_blank">Citizens</a> to make some cool 
looking NPC's. If you can't afford to buy it you can download it for free.
Just give the first paragraph of their Spigot page a good read and you will find the link. Also put the `Citizens.jar` file in your servers plugin folder.

Once you have installed these start up your server!

##YAML Syntax
Before we can start you need to understand the fundamentals of YAML.
You have no idea what that is? Well YAML is the format most plugins store their config data in!
Its key:value based which means that you will always have to name the thing that you write down before you actually
write it down. Let me show you an example:
    Icon design
!!! example "YAML Key:Value"
        ```YAML
        key: "value"
        name: "your thing"
        ```
These keys and values can also be nested into each other:
!!! ""


YAML also cares a lot about spaces and tabs! You are not allowed to use tabs in your YAML files at all. You have to
 use spaces though.
 
Work in progress! 
More about Spaces & Tabs, the VSCode addon, Windows file extensions and `""` soon!
