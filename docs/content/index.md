BetonQuest is an advanced and powerful quests plugin. 
It offers RPG-style conversations with NPCs and a very flexible quest system.
The **multi-path conversations** can be displayed in many ways, from chat to GUI, to all-new technologies.
BetonQuest is not limited to simple, repetitive quests but can also power highly flexible quests
that have never been seen before. This is made possible by **support for more than 20 other plugins** such as
Citizens, Heroes, JobsReborn, Magic, McMMO and MythicMobs. You can also interact with other quest plugins
such as Quests and LegendQuests to maintain compability with existing Quests on your server. In case your server
uses Denizen or Skript - we've got you covered too.
