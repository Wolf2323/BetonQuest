## Objectives

### `MmoCoreBreakBlock`

__Context__: @snippet:objective-meta:online@  
__Syntax__: `mmocorebreakblock <amount> [block]`  
__Description__: The player needs to break [special blocks from MMOCore](https://gitlab.com/phoenix-dvpmt/mmocore/-/wikis/Mining%20and%20Block%20Regen).

Please note that you *must* use this objective over `block` if you are using MMOCore's custom mining system.
All three different block types and an amount can be defined. You can also send notifications to the player by appending
the `notify` keyword optionally with the notification interval after a colon.

This objective has three properties: `amount`, `left` and `total`. `amount` is the amount of blocks already broken,
`left` is the amount of blocks still left to break and `total` is the amount of blocks initially required.

```YAML title="Example"
objectives:
  block1: "mmocorebreakblock 5 block:1"      #A custom block's block ID
  stone: "mmocorebreakblock 64 block:STONE"  #vanilla material
  head: "mmocorebreakblock 1 block:eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVy" #... this is a heads texture data
```

### `MmoChangeClass`

__Context__: @snippet:objective-meta:online@  
__Syntax__: `mmochangeclass [class]`  
__Description__: Requires the player to change their class.

  selectMage: "mmochangeclass class:MAGE actions:startMageIntroQuest"

### `MmoProfessionLevelUp`

__Context__: @snippet:objective-meta:online@  
__Syntax__: `mmoprofessionlevelup <profession> <level>`  
__Description__: Requires the player to level the given profession to the specified level.

Use `main` to check for class level ups.

## Conditions

### `MmoClass`

__Context__: @snippet:condition-meta:online-offline@  
__Syntax__: `mmoclass <class> [equal]`  
__Description__: Whether the player has the given MMOCore class.

You can check for any class that is not the default class by writing `*` instead of a class name.
If a level has been specified the player needs to be on that level or higher to meet the condition.
You can disable this behaviour by adding the `equal` argument.

```YAML title="Example"
conditions:
  5: "mmoclass * 5"
  warrior: "mmoclass WARRIOR"
  mage5: "mmoclass MAGE 5"
  mage5Equal: "mmoclass MAGE 5 equal"

__Syntax__: `mmoattribute <attribute> <level> [equal]`  
__Description__: Whether the player has the specified attribute on the given level or higher.

You can disable this behaviour by adding the `equal` argument.

```YAML title="Example"
conditions:
  strength2: "mmoattribute strength 2"
  strength2Equal: "mmoattribute strength 2 equal"
```

### `MmoProfession`

__Context__: @snippet:condition-meta:online-offline@  
__Syntax__: `mmoprofession <profession> <level> [equal]`  
__Description__: Whether the player has the specified profession on the given level or higher.
