**BetonQuest 2.0 is currently in development.**  
This is a progress, that will take some time.
During this process, APIs will change maybe more than one time.
To help you relay on the APIs that we touch, we give you a state for it.  
The states are defined as followed:

### Experimental
This is a first try of a new API implementation.
Sure, the goal is always to develop a final and stable API.
But APIs that are marked with the `Experimental` tag, are just reimplemented.
They will change again, depending on bugs, feedback and missing features or improvements. 

### Unstable
If we are pretty sure the state of Experimental is over, but we can not guarantee,
that nothing will change, we tag it with `Unstable`.
You can use it, but it could still happen, that we change something, but we try to prevent it.
The main reason here for a change is a bug or main missing features or improvements.

### Stable
This is the point, where we already did some changes to a new or reimplemented API, and we tagged it as `Stable`.
We are pretty sure, that we will not change something excepting for bugs or other main mistakes in the API design.
This should be safe to use, as we also care about compatibility when we change something here.
