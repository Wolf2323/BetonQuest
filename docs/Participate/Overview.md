There are mainly two options to support projects like this one:

## Donate Time :material-clock-time-four:

??? bug "Report Bugs"
    You just need to follow the bug report template on GitHub to
    [submit a bug report](https://github.com/BetonQuest/BetonQuest/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug&template=bug-report.yml).

??? info "Suggest Features"
    Features can be requested on [our Github discussions page](https://github.com/BetonQuest/BetonQuest/discussions). 
    Please make sure that:
    
    * The feature does not exist yet (Search docs / Ask on Discord)
    * No one has already requested it (Search GitHub discussion). You can comment on an existing discussion to add details.

??? note "Write Code or Documentation"
    We have written detailed guides about these two participation methods - they are the most significant time
    contributions after all. 
    
    Please follow our detailed [Setup Project](Setup-Project.md) guide to obtain a local working environment. 

    After that, you can follow the `Process` chapter. It explains every step in the contributing process.
    Start by [creating a new branch](Process/Create-a-new-Branch.md), then change
    [Code](Process/Code/index.md) or [Docs](Process/Docs/index.md)
    and finally [submit any changes](Process/Submitting-Changes.md) you made.
