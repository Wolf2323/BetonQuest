### Reporting bugs

??? bug "Report Bugs"
    You just need to follow the bug report template on GitHub to
    [submit a bug report](https://github.com/BetonQuest/BetonQuest/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug&template=bug-report.yml).

??? info "Suggest Features"
    Features can be requested on [our Github discussions page](https://github.com/BetonQuest/BetonQuest/discussions). 
    Please make sure that:
    
    * The feature does not exist (Search docs / Ask on Discord)

??? note "Write Code or Documentation"
    Please follow our detailed "[Setup Project](Setup-Project.md)" guide to obtain a local working environment.  
    From there we continue guiding you through [Create a new Branch](Process/Create-a-new-Branch.md), how you change
    [Code](Process/Code/index.md) or [Docs](Process/Docs/index.md)
    and how you finally [Submit Changes](Process/Submitting-Changes.md) you made.
